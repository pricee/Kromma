# Kromma

This project was made for an art installation for our Computer Science Projects Honors/Art and Technology Class. The installation consisted of inflatable, light-up beach balls that changed color and behavior according to sensor data, such as acceleration and sound. Currently, this is a work in progress :)

## Updates
2/10/18
* Neopixels can be programmed individually, accelerometer data prints in console, but the values don't change (so the data isn't helpful and probably is wrong)
