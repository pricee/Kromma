This project was made for an art installation for our Computer Science Projects Honors/Art and Technology Class. The installation consisted of inflatable, light-up beach balls that changed color and behavior according to sensor data, such as acceleration and sound. Currently, this is a work in progress :)

## Materials
* 1x Adafruit Feather 32u4 Basic Proto
* 1x LIS3DH 3-Axis Accelerometer
* 3x Adafruit RGB Smart Neopixels v2

## Updates
* 2/10/18
  * Neopixels can be programmed individually; accelerometer data prints in console, but the values don't change (so the data isn't helpful and probably is wrong)
* 3/8/18
  * Neopixels change color when accelerometer detects motion
